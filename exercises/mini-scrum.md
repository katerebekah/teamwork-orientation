## Create a Children’s Comic Book of... Goldilocks and the Three Bears
### Here is the summary: 
	Three bears decide to go for a walk because their breakfast is hot.
	While they are out, a bad girl, Goldilocks, walks into their house. She goes into the
	kitchen and tries the food that is in three bowls. The food in the first two bowls is not nice,
	but the third bowl she thinks is good. She tries their three chairs and likes the third one the
	best, but breaks it. Then she tries their three beds and falls asleep in the third one. The
	three bears come home and are angry about baby bear’s breakfast, chair and bed. They
	roar at Goldilocks and she runs home.
